# WeatherApp
Weather App using Flask
In this my first application I have used Pwskills lab, hence all the dependencies were avaiable there.

After creating the form using HTML from an existing page, The index.html file was modified to suit the current requirements of Weather App.
The cloud paltform used was render.com which provides the free service for hosting an application.

The app can be accessed by the below link:
